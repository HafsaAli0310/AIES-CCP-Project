## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Binary image classification: `Pothole` vs. `No Pothole`
- CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Detection from:
  - Single image
  - Video files
  - Webcam feed
- Visual display with bounding boxes and labels

## How to run?
###1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/pothole-detection-cnn.git
   cd pothole-detection-cnn

###2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed
   - TensorFlow / Keras
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - scikit-learn

###3. In python file, update the following paths:
    pothole_dir = 'Path to folder of pothole_pics'
    no_pothole_dir = 'Path to folder of other_pics'

    Then run:
    python filename.py
